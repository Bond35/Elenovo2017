## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r carstab}
library(knitr)
kable(head(mtcars), caption = "Data about cars")
```

In Table \@ref(tab:carstab) we can see some data about pressure.


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressureplot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Plot of car data"}
plot(pressure)
```

In Figure \@ref(fig:pressureplot) we can see some data about pressure.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

The End.
